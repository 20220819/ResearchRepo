# Research Den
Welcome to my Research Den/Repo. This is a place for me to store my notes, code and other things I'll need through out my time at Whitecliffe. My reflective journal is under the Software Dev section as well.

My personal mission throughout my time at this course is to refresh my previous knowledge and build upon this foundation by learning new skills to build a carrer in this industry.

## Other Junk I find interesting
### Stuff for Game Dev - Doom. All videos by Decino, he breaks down the basic game elements and explains the code used for the game.

I've found going through the 4 videos below by Decino inspiring as not only does he show and explain how Doom's code works to get all of it's various objects, enemies, weapons ect working which I feel will be enlightening for me on my path to become a game developer. The code used in the game is rather complex, however I feel as I develop along in my journey, coming back to these videos will be beneficial for me as I start to understand more and more with the languages I want to learn and forge my skills in.

The Resident Evil guide that I've been following and learning from is what I'll be basing my software project on. My mission is to complete a basic app where you'll be able to move a character, get them to shoot as well as being able to pick up an object, weapon fight a couple of enemies.

The biggest challenge for me is going to be making the level in which the player will explore. For the textures, I'll be using Dall-E mini to create the textures for walls and floors as I feel like this will be a quick way for me to create basic textures that will fit the aesthetic that I'm going for in this short demo.

As for the rest of the objects, as I have no skill in 3d modelling, I'll be using as many free assets that are available in the unity asset store to aide the creation of the software.
