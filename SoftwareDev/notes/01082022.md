# Week 2

Today we covered creating GitHub and what Git is mostly used for.

Git is a place to store and share code and is amazing for devs to share ideas and work together to create new software. Git is known for it's outstanding version control (Which saves every update to any files so you can go in and see what's changed, make notes and roll back any changes)

I didn't have many more notes for this day unfortunately, but I was actively listening to the tutor and created this very GitHub you're looking at now :D
