# Software Dev Week 3 - Lab

## Email From Roman
I really hope you enjoyed Sarmad's guest lecture on python for Monday? If so, did you let him know?

If you're struggling with this type of traditional coding, not to worry, we are back to free and creative work next week. In the meantime we have some brain-teasers to get through today. 

Example: Write a Python console program that calculates a dog's age in dog's years given human years.

Note: For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years. After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.

Your program should look as follows:

Input a dog's age in human years: 15

The dog's age in dog's years is 73.

Feel free to print out the attached file in smaller groups. Use Whiteboards, pair program (what is pair programming) and have fun. Remember to take a break every 50mins!

Save your workings, including what didn't work into your research repository. Reflect. Why didn't it work.

use these prompts as you're debugging and reflecting: What are you expecting? What are you getting? What have you tried so far?

Have a great afternoon coding!
