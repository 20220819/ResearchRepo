# Reflective Journal

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?

Scratch is an entry level visual programming platform, designed to teach you the building blocks of code. Essentially it is a lego set to start you on the journey of unleashing your creativity. One of its benefits is that due to it's Lego block nature, code will only fit together if it works together. It teaches the basics of coding through a fun and visual environment.

It also introduces the user into some of the basics of coding such as variables, if, else, if then, ect which helps to create a basic understading of how code works.

### What is visual programming

Visual programming is a programming method where coding is done through visual blocks and modules instead of typing just lines of code. It's a coding method/language that's used to program in words understandable to humans, as opposed to just typing in code. A benefit of a visual language is that it can help promote and visualise thinking about code and how things fit together and work instead of just typing endless lines of code. It can also help creatively, as you can often see how things work together and see results straight away.

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?

## Week 2:

In week two, we started to learn about git and github as well as it's values and use within the programming community. While I didn't fully understand how to push and pull code, I understand it's use. I'm sure over time in my programming journey, I'll learn by doing and fully understand the github work flow. While, I've had experience using github previously, I've never really understood it's purpose in the industry. Github is a powerful version tool that allows people to share code and colaborate with one another as well as make it easy for anyone to build from code that you've written and use the software or project that you've worked on.

Being able to push to github from coding software such as Visual Studio Code, makes it easy for you to store your code, make edits to it and for anyone to see the changes that you've made, revert said changes as well, and if you've made notes in your code, can see why you've made these changes. It also allows anyone you're colaborating with to leave a note on a push to question why you've made changes.

## Week 3

This week we were indroduced to python, and the basics of coding within this language. It is here in week three that cemented where I'd like to take my carrer. I started to understand the creativity that can be had with coding. During this week after our lecture, I went back and revisisted some videos by a youtuber called Decino, who deep dives into the code and how things work in the video game Doom. The programming by the legendary John Carmack is inspiring and it's after this lecture and starting to get my hands on creating things, that helped me make the decision to take my career into game development and become a programmer for video games. I've linked some of the videos I've found most intersting by Decino on the main page of this repository and have left notes about my take aways from these videos.

I did struggle initially with getting some things to work, especially the simple program to allow the user to type in a month and for the program to spit out how many days the month had. After doing some research I learned about for loops and dictionarys and eventually getting this to work was a high point for me so far in my coding journey. The feeling of overcoming and getting things to work was incredible.

## Week 4

Sadly due to our lecurer catching covid, we didn't have a lecture instead having a lecture during our lab time. The exercise that we went through involved everyone taking out their phones and being to film silmutainiously. As soon as someone left the frame, everyone stopped filming. The result was to get everyones phone and play the video all at once. To be honest, this lecture didn't do anything for me and I didn't walk away taking anything from this however I hope that people did take something away from this.

Instead, as I atteneded from home due to having flooding problems in my current home, I instead used this time to begin my journey into game devolpment by using unity. I have been following along with a tutorial to make a basic Resident Evil style game, which is one of my dream projects and a game that I've wanted to work on for years. This course has been the kick start for me to finally get up off my ass and start making and creating things I've wanted to create but have lacked the drive to do so. I've been creative all my life, mostly with music and more recently with content creation. One of the biggest things I get out of creating content and experiences is getting to engage with the end user and entertain them. It's this reasoning that I feel like my journey into becoming a developer will be satisfying and satiate my need to create experiences for people and I hope that I can create something that resonates with someone as many games and albums have done so with me. If I can reach one person and inspire them or create a meaningful experience, I'd consider my work a success.

## Main Feelings and thoughts as this is research repository is due

As I've begun my journey into development and reflecting back on the steps I've taken so far, I feel inspired and creative again. I'm scratching an itch that I've not been able to scratch since my band had stopped creating music together due to multiple different circumstances. Although live streaming and content creation has scratch that itch, there's been a part of me that's had the desire to create something else and make new experiences while continuing to entertain live via playing games for an audience.

This course has started me thinking about the different coding languages want to learn and the path that I'd like to take my life. Doing research on this, I've discovered that to get into the industry, I need to at least learn C++ and/or C#. Unity uses the language C# for its scriping of game objects, movement ect, so this is the language that I'd like to initially start to learn.

During my delve into creating something within unity, I've had to learn to code basic scripts in C# and I have been able to slightly understand it better due to the basics of Python that I've learned during my time at Whitecliffe so far. I'm excited to delve further into this path and get to share my work with people during our presentation in a few weeks.
