## Operating System (OS)
An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API). In addition, users can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI (GUI).

## BIOS - Basic Input/Output System
The BIOS is a basic system which is controlled by the motherboard. This is the first entry point for the system and is stored on the motherboard of the device. The BIOS sends basic commands to components, sets the boot order, stores the system clock and many more. If you have no OS installed on any device or want to reinstall/install a new/different OS, you'll need to come to the BIOS to do so. You can also change various other things from the BIOS such as, memory clock speed, voltages for RAM and CPU, timings for RAM ect.

## ISO
An ISO is a virtual copy of a physical disk. These are most commonly used to burn an "image" to a disk, such as a Windows installation disk. You can also use a virtual drive to mount the image to, so you can use the disk in your machine virtually. This is seperate from VMWare.

## Rufus

Rufus is a freeware tool used to create bootable USB sticks. This would most commonly be used for installing a linux ISO as Windows has it's own installer and bootable drive creation tool, however Rufus can create older version bootable sticks for previous versions of Windows that may not commonly be available.
