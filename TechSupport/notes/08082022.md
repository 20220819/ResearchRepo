# Technical Support Lecture - Week 3 8/8

IMPORTANT - GO THROUGH SLIDES FOR THIS LECTURE AGAIN AND EXTRACT INFORMATION - KC, PLEASE COMPLETE BY EOW 12/8

Expected by end of this week. 
1. Read through all tech support reading.
2. Complete rules ect with Spiceworks

## NETWORKING
Learning outcome - Explain hardware and software componets of a Network, including the internet for Planning a network for effective config and use.

### What is a Network
A network is a way to get "stuff" between 2 or more "things", EG Mail, phone system, conversations, railroad system, highways and roads.
Applications - Email, FTP, Video Conferencing ect

### Network Topology
Network Topology refers to the layout of a network. How different nodes in a netowrk are connected to each other and how they communicate. There are a few different versions of topologies. Mesh, Star, Bus, Ring, Hybrid

#### Star
One central switch, all devices go through one hub. 

#### Mesh
No central device, every device is connected to one another.

#### Ring
Devices connected in the form of the ring. Data is sent via a packet. One computer has a "ring token" this computer then receives any data intented for it, sends data then passes on the token.

#### Bus
All devices are connected to one main line, like a bus line (Eg a route with different stops)

#### Hybrid
This is a combonation of all of the different different networks

### Computer Network Architecture
Two main Architectures that get used, p2p (Peer to Peer) and Client/Server Network.

#### Peer to Peer
>p2p is similar to mesh network, computers are linked togetther with equal privilege and respoinisbilites for processing the data </br>
>p2p is useful for small environments, usually up to 10 computers </br>
>p2p has no dedicated server(s) (EA PLZ FIX) </br>
>Special permissions are assigened to each computer for sharing the resources, but this can lead to a problem if the computer with the resource is down  </br>
>A major downside is that theres no filtering for files, so malicious software could be shared easy. </br>

#### Client / Server
>C/S network is a network model designed for end users calle d clients, to access the resources such as songs, video ect from a central computer known as a Server.
>The central controller is known as a server while all other computers in the network are called Clients.
>A server performs all the major operations such as security and network management.
>A server is respoinsible for managing all the resources such as files, directories, printer ect.
>All the clients communicate with each other through a server. For example, if client 1 wants to send some data to client 2, then it firsts sents the requests to the server for permission, the server sends the response to c1 to initiate its communicate with client 2.

#### LAN (Local Area Network)
>A network in same physical location, such as home or building  </br>
>Usually 

#### WAN (Wide Area Network)
A WAN usually spans a large geographic area, such as connections between cities. Usually connected using a leased line, how to make sure it's secure, usually best to use a VPN to encrypt data.

#### MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
A MAN is a network that interconnects users within a same city.

### Data Transmission
Circuit Swithing vs Packet Switching

#### Circuit Switching
>Physical path between source and destination  </br>
>All packets use the same path  </br>
>Reserve the entire bandwidth in advance  </br>
>Badwidth Wastage </br>
>No store and forward transmission  </br>

#### Packet Switching
>No physical path  </br>
>Packets Traevel independently  </br>
>Does not reserve bandwidth  </br>
>No bandwidth wastage </br>
>Supports store and forward transmission </br>
>Routers take one packet at a time, sends it to the destination </br>

### Protocols and Standards
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), Ethernet 802.3, WiFi - 802.11

All communication goes through the OSI model. Sender goes down the OSI model, receiver goes up the OSI Model.
