Task-2:  You have a class ‘C’ IP address 205.11.2.0, you have to make 30 subnets.  -What is the subnet mask for maximum number of hosts -How many hosts can each subnet have? -What is the IP address of host 3 on subnet 2?
Subnet Mask for Maximum amount of hosts = 255.255.255.248
6 Hosts Per Subnet
IP address for Host 3 on Subnet 2 is 205.11.2.3

Task-3:  Your organization has been assigned the network number 150.25.0.0/16 and it needs to create a set of subnets that supports up to 150 hosts on each subnet. -Calculate the subnet mask -Find the IP address of host 5 on subnet 2
Subnet Mask
